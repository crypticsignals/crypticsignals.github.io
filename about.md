title: "About Me"
---

I am a cybersecurity graduate from the University of North Georgia. I currently have 7 years of customer service under my belt, and I'm excited to expand my cybersecurity skills as well.

I enjoy computing as a hobby, too, specifically on the Linux side. In February of 2024 I switched from using Windows to using Linux Mint. A few months down the line I switched from using that to using Fedora Linux. And lastly, as of late April, I am a happy NixOS user.

I am quite passionate about music. I love listening to it and playing my bass guitar. I enjoy listening to about anything but my favorite genres have to be heavy metal (+any adjacent genre), synthpop, and indie.
